    "instructions": [
      "READ THE ENTIRE DOCUMENT CAREFULLY - Don't just scan for keywords. Understand the document's structure, context, and content holistically.",
      "ACCEPT KEYWORD VARIATIONS - Field labels may appear in multiple formats: camelCase (businessName), Title Case (Business Name), lowercase (business name), UPPERCASE (BUSINESS NAME), with spaces, without spaces, with underscores, etc.",
      "USE CONTEXTUAL UNDERSTANDING - Information may not always have explicit labels. Use context clues, document structure, and common sense. For example, a company name may appear in a document title or header without any label.",
      "LOOK FOR PATTERNS - Numbers, dates, addresses, and structured data often follow recognizable patterns even without labels. A 9-digit number formatted ##-####### is likely an EIN/Tax ID. A 5-digit number after a state abbreviation is likely a ZIP code.",
      "BE FLEXIBLE WITH FORMATS - Data may appear in various formats: '$1,250,000' vs '1250000.00' vs '1.25M' for currency; '8 years' vs 'Since 2017' vs 'Established: 2017' for time periods.",
      "CHECK DOCUMENT HEADERS AND FOOTERS - Important identifiers like business names, dates, and document types often appear in headers, footers, or document titles.",
      "UNDERSTAND DOCUMENT TYPES - Financial statements have revenue in income statements, addresses appear in letterheads, claims data is in loss runs. Use document type context to guide extraction.",
      "EXTRACT COMPLETE VALUES - Don't truncate values. For addresses, get the full street address. For descriptions, capture the complete sentence or paragraph.",
      "CALCULATE WHEN NEEDED - If you see a founding year (e.g., 'Founded: 2017'), calculate years in operation (2025 - 2017 = 8 years).",
      "MAINTAIN DATA INTEGRITY - Extract values exactly as they appear. Don't modify formatting unless specifically instructed. Preserve entity suffixes (LLC, Inc., Corp.) in business names."
